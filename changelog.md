## [5.2.2] - 2024-10-12

### Changed

- Resolved deprecation warnings related to return type declarations in PHP 8+.
- Addressed dynamic property creation warnings in pagination for PHP 8+ compatibility.

## [5.2.1] - 2022-06-21

### Changed

- Fix inconsistent reflection return type with PHP8's `ReflectionParameter::getType()`.

## [5.2.0] - 2019-09-03

### Added

- New `Hybrid\Attr\Attr\with()` method for passing data into the attributes system.
- Above `with()` method will auto-handle a `'post'` parameter of `WP_Post` for post attributes.
- New `Hybrid\Comment\render_author_link()` and `display_author_link()` function.

### Changed

- `.sticky` class renamed to `.is-sticky`.

## [5.1.0] - 2019-07-16

### Added

- New `Hybrid\View\Engine` wrapper class for the view system, which gets passed to view templates as the `$engine` variable.
- The `View` instances gets passed to view templates as the `$view` variable.

## [5.0.3] - 2019-06-16

### Changed

- The `Template` class should not have a defined `$subtype` by default. Any templates registered should work with all subtypes (post types in most cases) unless otherwise specified.

## [5.0.2] - 2019-04-04

### Added

- New `link` argument to enable/disable the link for `Hybrid\Post\render_author()`.

### Fixed

- Corrected misspelling of `archive` in the `hybrid/archive/title` hook.
- Use `get_comments_number_text()` instead of `get_comments_number()` to get appropriate comments text.
- Added the missing `.wp-embed-responsive` body class if supported.
- Make sure to show `$before` and `$after` args for the comment reply link if there's a link.

## [5.0.1] - 2018-12-11

### Fixed

- Corrected inline doc `@return` value for `Hybrid\View\View::locate()`.
- Runs the template hierarchy through `array_unique()` to avoid duplicates when other plugins hook into core WP's template hierarchy.
- Adds missing `datetime` attributes to `<time>` elements.
- Correctly show `.menu__item--ancestor` class when viewing single posts of a given post type when that post type archive is the menu item.  This fixes the issue with the class incorrectly appearing on normal pages.

## [5.0.0] - 2018-09-13

Version 5.0.0 represents a complete break from earlier versions. The framework was essentially rewritten from the ground up to utilize more modern PHP practices. The notes below will be a bit more broad than focusing on the minute details because nearly every line of code in the project has changed.

### Added

- An application class was added to have a formal method of booting the framework from the theme. This solved a lot of problems like auto-loading code that wasn't needed and providing a point of contact between the theme and the framework to work together. This allows theme authors to create service providers and bind things to the container.
- The framework now has a container for managing class dependencies and dependency injection. For the purposes of theme development, this will allow theme authors to write better classes, avoid globals and singletons, and create shared instances of objects/data.
- Contracts (interfaces) now play an integral role in how the framework functions. Nearly every class implements one of the available contracts. When used in conjunction with the container, this allows theme authors to plug in custom implementations for features they want to change. Contracts are self-documenting by providing an overview of how any given class works by exposing its public methods.
- A collection class was created for storing key/value pairs. This class allows you to interact with the collection of data as an object or array, depending on your needs.
- A pagination class was added for consistent handling of pagination for posts, comments, and multi-page single views.
- The view system overhauls how template parts are handled. It allows theme authors to utilize sub-folders for housing files, creating a hierarchy, and passing data to templates.
- Created filters for many front-end features of WordPress to utilize a BEM-style HTML class naming scheme.

### Changed

- A minimum of WordPress 4.9.6 is now required.
- A minimum of PHP 5.6+ is now required for all themes built from the framework. PHP 7.0+ is strongly recommended, and theme authors are encouraged to bump their own minimums up if possible.
- Using PHP namespaces is perhaps the biggest change of all. Everything within the framework now falls under the `Hybrid` namespace.  Nearly every class and function beyond that is properly categorized in a sub-namespace based on the feature.
- Composer is required for including the framework with the theme. While it's possible to download and drop the framework into a theme folder and build a custom autoloader, that method is no longer officially supported and will likely be tough to do in the future if dependencies are added.
- Classes and folder names now follow the [PSR-4 autloading standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/).  This means that the files and folders are named literally based on the class name and sub-namespace, respectively. We no longer prefix class files with `class-`.
- Classes are now loaded via the PSR-4 autoloader included with Composer.
- Hooks are namespaced and closely follow our PHP namespaces (for the most part). Hooks are in the form of `hybrid/{$subnamespace}/{$hook}`.
- The framework no longer auto-loads translations for themes.  Both parent and child themes should handle this on their own.
- We no longer auto-enqueue the comment reply script and are leaving this for theme authors to decide what to do on their own.

### Removed

- The Breadcrumb Trail extension is now a separate package named [Hybrid Breadcrumbs](https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-breadcrumbs).
- The Get the Image extension is now a separate packaged named [Hybrid Carbon](https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-carbon).
- The customizer controls, settings, and related code were ported to the [Hybrid Customize](https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-customize) project.
- The Google font system was ported to the [Hybrid Font](https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-font) project.
- Theme Layouts was removed but will likely return as a separate, add-on repository.
- Cleaner Gallery was likewise removed. Whether it becomes a new project will depend on feedback.
- `HYBRID_URI` constant. The framework no longer ships any assets. Therefore, this is unnecessary.
- Automatic post format support by filtering `the_content`. It seems that core WP is never going to address the shortcomings of post formats, so we've just been fighting a losing battle that most theme authors aren't even participating in.

## [4.0.0] - 2017-07-31

### Added

* `.wp-custom-logo` body class.
* Allow the shortcode, autoembeds, embedded, and attached methods of the media grabber to be enabled/disabled.
* New Fonts API.  This allows developers to register, enqueue, etc. fonts just like scripts and styles.  The API natively supports font stylesheets bundled with the theme or the Google Fonts API.
* Introduces the `hybrid_get_theme_mod()` wrapper function, which provides a `hybrid_theme_mod_{$name}_default` filter hook for filtering the default theme mod.
* Adds a the `hybrid_is_layout()` conditional tag for checking if the current page has a specific layout.
* Adds a `hybrid_is_script_debug()` conditional function for checking if `WP_SCRIPT_DEBUG` is set.
* Adds the `hybrid_sprintf_theme_dir()` and `hybrid_sprintf_theme_uri()` functions. These functions replace `%1$s` with the template and `%2$s` with the stylesheet directory path and URI, respectively.
* Introduces `hybrid_get_embed_template()` and an embed template part system.  This allows theme authors to create embed templates based on the post type, format, etc.
* Full admin support for taxonomy term layouts.
* Added the `hybrid()` wrapper function for returning the instance of the `Hybrid` object.
* Adds the `hybrid_widget_exists()` conditional function for checking if a widget (by class name) exists.
* Introduces the `hybrid_comment_parent_link()` and `hybrid_get_comment_parent_link()` functions for displaying or getting the comment parent link of a child comment.
* Creates a new `hybrid_get_template_part()` function, which is a more robust version of the core WP `get_template_part()` function.
* Introduces `hybrid_verify_nonce_post()` and `hybrid_verify_nonce_request()` for easier nonce checking in the admin.
* Adds the `hybrid_get_content_hierarchy()` helper function for content and embed templates.  It retrieves the hierarchy based on post type, format, etc.
* New `.menu-item-parent-archive` nav menu item class when viewing a post and the post type archive item is in the menu.
* New template registration system.  This is post templates on steroids while being completely compatible with core WP's post template system.  Term and user templates are supported but no UI is yet implemented.
* New filter on `document_title_parts`.  This is actually a replacement for the old filter on `wp_title`.  This brings us up to date with new doc title hooks and uses less code.
* Adds the `hybrid_post_media()` and `hybrid_get_post_media()` wrapper functions for displaying and getting post media.  These are wrappers for the media grabber.
* New registry system for registering and storing collections of data on the page.  This replaces some of the old factory/registry methods from before and combines the functionality into a single class.
* Added the `hybrid_attr` hook for a more global filter on attributes.
* Added the `hybrid_attr_{$slug}_class` hook for theme authors to filter just the `class` attribute.

### Changed

* Split the archive description filter into two distinct functions:  one for filtering changing the text output and a later function for formatting.
* Registers Hybrid's styles on the front end, embeds, login page, and admin for use.
* Attribute system now allows for `0` or `'0'` as valid attribute values.  `false` is for explicit empty values.
* Overhauled the attributes (`hybrid_attr()`) system.  The framework no longer defines Schema.org as a default.  It leaves this up to theme authors.  Additionally, it only sets defaults for the body, post, and comment attributes.  The framework is just providing the foundation for theme authors to build what they want without getting in their way.
* The `Hybrid` class is now a singleton class.  Theme authors should no longer call `new Hybrid()`.  The framework will launch itself.
* User-selected page templates now overrule the theme author's choice if the theme author included a `front-page.php`.
* Adds the Hybrid Core version to its own stylesheets when registering.
* The template hierarchy system now uses the `*_template_hierarchy` filter hooks as opposed to the `*_template` filter hooks. This means that our code runs before looking up templates, which speeds things up.
* Updated the meta registration calls to be in line with the new WP method of registration.

### Removed

* All deprecated functions have been completely removed or added to the "removed" section.  Version 4.0.0 is a major release and not concerned with back-compat.
* Remove old post template admin and functionality since core WP now supports this.  It only took WP 7 years to catch up to the awesomeness that Hybrid users have long been enjoying.
* Mobile toggle script was removed in favor of just letting theme authors handle it.
* The global `$hybrid` variable is now dead.  Good riddance.
* Add the `render_content()` method for JS-based customizer controls to make sure we overwrite the `WP_Customize_Control` method.
* The Post Styles feature is now gone.  It was rarely used and just added bloat.
* Old filter on `wp_title`.
* Media meta, template, and layout hybrid factory-registry classes.

### Fixed

* Logic bug with post layout check.
* Post format body class error check.
* Make sure filters on `hybrid_content_template` work correctly.
* Remove 100% max width default for embeds, which caused the WP visual editor to infinitely grow in height when embedding an audio/video file.
* Make sure we have a nav menu object before attempting to get its name in `hybrid_get_menu_name()`.
* Missing `href` attribute for the `hybrid_get_image_size_links()` function.
* Make sure a layout exists before attempting to use it as the layout.
* Fixed incorrect call when unregistering a theme layout.
* Load the minified admin CSS file.
* Use `https` for the WordPress.org link.
* Adds the missing `.page-template-default` body class when no custom template is in use.
* Change the search results title to `Search results for: %s`. This avoids double quotation marks.

### Security

* Run `wp_kses_post()` over the content when splitting media from it in the media grabber.

## [3.0.0] - 2015-08-17

### Added

* Media grabber now supports the `[gallery]` shortcode.
* Custom attributes can now be passed into `hybrid_attr()`.
* Fix for core WP issues that doesn't allow users to edit the posts page content.

* Complete overhaul of theme layouts with a new Layouts API and many UI and other improvements.
* The post class now has the `.has-pages` class when it's a paged post.
* New `Hybrid_Chat` class that better handles chat posts.
* New `hybrid_is_plural()` function to go along with core WP's `is_singular()`.
* New `hybrid_get_attachment_type()` and `hybrid_get_attachment_subtype()` functions for getting attachment mime types.
* WordPress.org and theme URLs now use the translated URLs if available so that translators can link to language-specific pages/sites.
* Language-specific PHP files are now loaded from the child theme (first) and parent theme.
* New media metadata class and functions.  This makes it easy to get media file metadata for attachments (limited to audio, video, and images).
* Adds context-based classes to sidebars and menus.
* Post stylesheets extension now built into the framework.  Added extra functions.
* Added extra functions for working with post templates.
* Adds support for WP's `title-tag` feature.

### Changed

* `Hybrid` class now loads a few things at different priorities for more flexibility.
* Files and folders were renamed and restructured to make a bit more sense.
* Only load extensions if both the theme supports them and if the file exists.
* Overhauled the constants.
* Coding style updates.  PHPDoc blocks stay the same.  Single-line comments within functions now use `//` and single-line comments within the file use `#`.
* The theme-specific "template" `<meta>` tag is now a "generator" `<meta>` tag.
* All framework constants have a trailing slash.

### Deprecated

* `hybrid_loop_title()` in favor of WP's `the_archive_title()`.
* `hybrid_loop_description()` in favor of WP's `the_achive_description()`.
* `loop_pagination()` in favor of WP's `the_posts_pagination()`.
* `hybrid_get_attachment_id_from_url()` in favor of WP's `attachment_url_to_postid()`.

### Removed

* Dropped the `hybrid_is_textdomain_loaded()` functionality (wasn't used since 2.0.0).
* `reset.css` stylesheet.
* `hybrid-core-styles` and `hybrid-core-scripts`.  The specific styles/scripts are now registered, leaving the enqueue to theme authors.
* Filter on image size names.
* Filter on id3 keys.
* Several text strings in an effort to make the framework have as few text strings as possible.
* `hybrid_admin_setup()`, which was not really needed.
* Title attributes for most everything for better accessibility.
* bbPress theme support filter removal.
* Atomic hooks functionality.
* Random Custom Background extension.
* Featured Header extension.
* Cleaner Caption extension.
* Custom background customizer control.
* Textarea customizer control.

* Schema.org body/content/post errors.
* Media grabber fix when WP auto-embed returns a shortcode.
* Fixed invalid `itemprop` attribute for comment reply link with no space.

### Security

* Many text strings are now escaped on output to harden security.
* Better escaping over URLs to harden security.
